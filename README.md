This is a full-stack web application I have built for my client. The product allowers user to interact with her artwork and contact her via a simple form. The tech stack I used was Mongo DB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS. I implemented an art gallery and a carousel for her images. I also implemented a live instant comments update, using Pusher, NodeJS and ExpressJS. All my images and comments are stored in a database called Mongo DB.
